In other words we can not visit firstly vertex with the wave number 15 if we have vertex with number 10, because the wave 10 will come early than 15. So, each time we actually choose the vertex with smallest number. And this is mean that we not need to move through all waves. There is enoughs just take the vertex with (again) smallest number.
