    "In previous lecture we spoke about special task type calling Combinatorial optimization. Lets remember them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Combinatorial optimization` problem in simple words is task where you should choose the optimal subset from the set of elements to get the \"best\" result of some function (usually it mean take the minimum or maximum of function value). More formally - we have `F(y1,y2,y3,...)` and the set `X = {x1,x2,...,xN}` - our task is choose `K` elements from set `X` to get a maximum\\minimum of `F` value. Wherein `F` can be depend on number of elements (K), for example the less elements we take the bigger value of `F` we got, or on the set of elements (for example the bigger element we take the better result we get). But more often our number `K` is depend on some other parameter of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus to this, `F` can be divided into two parts - `f(y1,y2,...)` the function of result that we need maximize\\minimize and `k(y1,y2,...)` system of inequalities that describe the restrictions on the elements that we can use. More often it look like `K < |y1| + |y2| + ...`, where |yi| is some parameter like volume of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "![coins](images/10-21/coin0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, plus to this at previous lecture we discuss one of the most simple and famous type of algorithm that can solve some types of Combinatorial optimization tasks - Greedy algorithm. Unfortunately it has a lot of limitation, so we need to think about different algorithm for this task type. Fortunately there is another one famous algorithm - Dynamic programming."

    "## Dynamic programming main idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually it is not a ready-made algorithm but rather a scheme how to create an algorithm for solving the task. Let's go straight to a simple example - Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fibonacci](images\\10-28\\fibonacci.jfif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task we should calculate the number `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, but I think you remember that. So, let look to this algorithm more closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all - there is 'recursion function call' mean that the answer for the some n is depend of answers from previous n-1,n-2 and etc. . More formally - each step of our algorithm should calculate from the data from previous steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the main idea of such algorithm is divide our task into parts and try to solve the subtasks. The main problem of such way is that there is not any good schedule to create the subtasks for our task. Sometimes there are obvious like in Fibonacci numbers. But more often there are not, for example the backpack task. We need to maximize the cost of packages, but what subtask we should solve to take the answer? With less packages, or with less volume inside backpack? The right answer are both, but you should choose such subtasks that can also be divided into subtasks and the result of which can be calculated from they subtasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "More simple and formally - you should create some logical or mathematical function `Fun(X,K) = Fun1 (Fun(X1,K1), Fun(X2,K2),...)`, where `X`,`K` - our elements and conditions, and `Xi`,`Ki` is subsets from them for some subtasks, and `Fun1` is the function that can help calculate the answer for `Fun(X,K)` from subfunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fibonacci numbers `Fun(X,K)` is `F(N)`, `Fun1(Fun(X1,K1),Fun(X2,K2))` is the sum of elements and `X` is an `N` - the ordinal number of Fibonacci number."

    "## Top-down and Bottom-up algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the Fibonacci numbers are top-down algorithm, means that we have some target that we should calculate. And to calculate it we should divide our task into subtasks `F(n-1)` and `F(n-2)`. But there can be the bottom-up algorithm, for example, \"Find the Fibonacci number that is less than `N`\". This means that we don't have our finished computation goal, but we have some inequalities and `f` function that we should maximize. And to do this for Fibonacci numbers we began from the beginning (`F(0)` and `F(1)`) and calculate all elements till not meet the required element.\n",
    "\n",
    "![top-down-fib](images\\10-28\\top-down-fib.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "More often you can solve the task both ways, because the top-down algorithm can be easily transferred into the bottom-up algorithm by just creating the condition like (till we do not meet the X from which we call our task). But there can be problems with unnecessary calculations. Because we can calculate some subtasks that are not needed inside our end goal. But more often to calculate dynamic algorithms all subtasks are required without exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other direction ascending to descending algorithms, it can work not always. Let's take the same example that we took before - calculate the n for the maximum Fibonacci number that is less than N. For such a task there are not any `Fun` functions that we can call recursively. But still, such a way of solving the algorithm is more efficient than the bottom-up because it calls only such functions that we needed."

First one - the volume of backpack, second one - boxes with volume and cost (from it we have the number of boxes and parametrs for each one). And at each step we should deside what box we need to take now. But lets look like at steps from the other side - at each step we will deside will we put the item under the number `i` into our backpack. And from this point we can create subfunctions - for the first step we should understand what will be the total cost of the backpack if we put the item and do not put the item.
