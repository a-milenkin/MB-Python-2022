When you use some algorithms, you should know, how it work, how many memory it can take, and how long it can work. So, in other worlds, the last two points calling **complexity of algorithm**. In mathematic laguage it's look like function `f(x)` whose values are equal to time algorithm will take if it will start working with data of size 'x'. Actually we can excatly calculate f(x), but it will take a big amount of time and resources.

    "So, like in previous containers, let's look at what we can do with list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constructor - `O(1)`\n",
    "2. GetAtIndex (i) - take element from list with index (the number of elements between the first and the requested). Because every element of list saved at diffrent position in memory (they are not stored one by one) and have link to next element, we need to go through all the elements starting from the first to requested. So, in average `O(n)`.\n",
    "3. FindElement (element) - search for element in list. `O(n)`\n",
    "4. PushBack (element) - save element at the end of the list. `O(1)` (because we can keep link to the end of the list)\n",
    "5. PopBack () - Take element from the end. `O(1)`\n",
    "6. PushFront (element) - save element at the begining of list. `O(1)`\n",
    "7. PopFront - Take element from the begining. `O(1)`\n",
    "8. ChangeElement (elem, changeElem) - change element 'elem' to 'changeElem'. `O(n)` to find element and `O(1)` to change it.\n",
    "9. InsertElem (elem, position) - if position is the link to list, than it will cost `O(1)`, because we only need to create new element and connect lists at position (previous and next) to new one. This is main differences from array, because for array insert element in middle require rewrite all array.\n",
    "10. DeleteElem (position or elem) - if position was given, than `O(1)`, becuse we need only relink previous and next lists to each other and delete old one. If element was given, than `O(n)` to find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "About implementation - in contrast with stack and queue, there is only one basic implementataion of list - with structure, that contain link to next (and previous, if double linked) element and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no linked or double linked list in basic python. The list that you use in it is actualy array and work as array (with O(1) access time and O(n) adding element to begining). So, if you want, you can implemented it by your oun."
