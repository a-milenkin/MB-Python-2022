    "## Combinatorial optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we move to a new type of tasks - combinatorial optimization tasks. Them are the parts of mathematical optimization, but we won't touch such complexity structure and discuss only simple variant of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `Combinatorial optimization` task in simple words is task where you should choose the optimal subset from the set of elements to get the \"best\" result of some function (usually it mean take the minimum or maximum of function value). More formally - we have F(y1,y2,y3,...) and the set X = {x1,x2,...,xN} - our task is choose K elements from set X to get a maximum\\minimum of F value. Wherein F can be depend on number of elements (K), for example the less elements we take the bigger value of F we take, and it can be depend on the set of elements (for example the bigger element we take the better result we get). But more often our number K is depend on some other parameter  of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple example: we have an `N` coins and we need take not more than `K` of them and maximize the sum. So here we have a simple function `F` that calculate the sum of elements and become zero value when the amount of elements become bigger than K. To simplify we can divide `F` to `f (y1,y2,...)` and system of inequalities (in this task only one inequality - `n<K` >). In result like in the task - we need maximize `f (y1,y2,...)` with no more than K elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's slightly redo our example: Now we have an infinite amount of coins with denominations {1,2,3}. Our task is take a number N with minimal number of coins. So, in this variant our `f (y1,2,...)` is the amount of coins and the \"inequality\" is `sum (y1,y2,...) = N`. Both of this two tasks are calling \"Coin change task\". There is an another one variant of such task - When denominations of coins is not consecutive numbers but something like {5,3,2} and the problem may not have a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![coins](images/10-21/coin0.png)\n",

    "## Full search\n",
    "\n",
    "So, first of all we have some function F that we should bring to minimum or maximum value on the set of elements {x1,...,xN}. If not think carefully what we can do with this? Sounds funny but steal, the first solution that we can imagine is try some bundle of elements inside F and write the result. Then try some other bundle and continue like this till we not try all possible bundles of elements. This method is called `Full search`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's main idea as we discussed early is try all possible bunches of elements in the set. Sounds like a plan. All that we need is understand the task to create correct function `f` with all needed inequality and then wait till computer not found the best bundle among all. But wait a second - what about the complexity of such algorithm? Let's calculate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, we have a set `X = {x1,..,xN}`. Now, to create a bundle we need take some elements from it. In tasks there can be dynamically amount of element (for example second variant of coin task). So, for example we take the element x1, now we should go over all bundles with `fixed` first element `x1`. The number of such bundles is equal to number of bundles of set `{x2,x3,...,xN}` because it is exactly the bundle without first element. Plus to this, we can fix each element of bundle as first element, so we have N * |{x2,...,xN}| bundles in sum. Let's move on and repeated all reasoning -> `N * (N-1) * |{x3,...,xN}|` -> -> -> `N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * 1` = N! (where ! is factorial). So, our complexity is O(N!) what is really big because N! ~ e^N = exp(N). As you remember from complexity table\n",

    "\n",
    "Complexity of exp(N) (or 2^N as describe in table) is unimaginable big. And this is the number of steps. So, if we will have about 100 or more coins this number become too big to calculate"

Ok, now about matroids:\n",

    "  - And finally let is assume that `A` and `B` are sets of packages with the volume less than `V` and `|A| < |B|`. Let's take any element from `B\\A` and call it `x`. And we meet the problem, because for some `A` and `B` may not exist such x. For example if `|B| - |A| = 1` and minimum package volume is 2. So, we can't add to any `A` some element to made from it new `A1` that will be the part of matroid. And because of this this task can not be solved by Greedy algorithm.\n",
