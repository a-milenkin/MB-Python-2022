    "Let's remember how looks like usuall arrays. It is container, that contain some amount of elements where each element has a index - number, where we or array can find this element. \\[5,4,6,7\\] - element 6 has index 2 (as you remember indices are counted from 0). But what to do if we want take element with index 'car' in array 'person'. I mean if we want just ask array person\\['car'\\] and take his car model. So, the interface for such array called 'Associative array'.\n",

    "First of all, it is a dynamic array with non constant memory. You can add elements to it even if it is full. Secondly, actualy it is not an array, it is container with pairs (\"key\",\"value\"). In simple world key is index of array, value... is value). The same as for other containers there are several implementations of dynamic array. But most of them have the same interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construct - O(n).\n",
    "2. Add element ('key','value') - add to array element with index 'key' and value. There are no exact time limits for this operation, but in the most famous implementations it take O(1) or O(logN) in worst.\n",
    "3. Delete element ('key') - mark the memory with 'key' element as empty. The value will be deleted.\n",
    "4. Find of \\[key\\] - find element with 'key' index.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I sayide before, there are several implementation of Associative array. \n",
    "\n",
    "First one to create data structure for such arrays, it works quite simple and can be simply described. But in some way it unmutable. Mean if you want to add value with the key that not describe in structure - you should create new structure for such data.\n",

    "There is a simpler and more effective method - use array that contain pairs (key,value) as values. With binary search you can find any element with diffictulties O(logN).\n",

    "The third one - use the search tree, that contain (key,value) inside every node. We will discus it in next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finaly, we can use hash tables. It literally gives the answer to queries like \\[Object\\], where the object can literally be any class. The only point is that the hash function must be able to work with these objects. Wait, hash funtion? Yep, here we come to the concept of a hash table. "

    "Ok, fomaly Hash table is another one container that was created as array with fast (in average O(1)) access and composite indices (the ability to use any class as an index). So, usually array uses numbers as indices not because we like numbers (we like numbers?) but because it is simplest way to find element in memory (just summ begining of array with element number). So how can we find element in hash table with complex key? The answer is hash function. And it is main idea of hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes a key as a argument and returns a number - real index of element in array. Ok, how you can see hash table is a usual array, where we do not take the indices directly, but calculate them from the keys using a hash function. Sounds good, but we need to find such function. And more of it, this function should give us a unique index for every key. But what if such keys about million, billion or more, like key - word with ten or twenty symbols. There is about 23^20 variants. Quite a bit of. In addition to this, how do we make such a function truly unique if the keys have no digits and are generally quite complex?\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, no way. Because of realy big amount of diffrenet types of keys instead of trying to do this we would modified our array and hash function to minimize such matches. Firstly, let's take some function that turn our keys into numbers. For example for stinrg keys lets calculate the sum of symbols using encoding table. For example word 'wow' in UTF8."

So, now we can calculate some number for each word, but there are many words with identical sum of characters. And what to do about it? Ok, firstly our array has limited size and there is not good idea if we ask it to resize just because we have a two elements with key 1 and 47482587629842346987698. To solve it let's remember modulo division. By definition, taking a number a modulo b means that we take the remainder of dividing a by b. For exmaple 15 dividing to 4 give us remainder 3 (because 4*3 + 3 = 15). Ok, so we have our array size and key-number that we got from hash function and we can just to calculate calculate key modulo array size that brings us the actual index in the array. And if the array is not yet filled to the level when it is already required to increase its size we just put element into index.\n",

And when we get two elements with the same hash fuction, we just put them inside a list (to begining of list) with the index equal to hash function result. To get element, we take a first element of list from the cell with the index equal to hash function and go through the list to find the element with our key (original one, because hash function is the same for all of them).\n",

In the same time other cells is still empty. It will be cost a lot of memory and a quite time to search for element. Abou `O(k)`, where k - average length of element. But we steel want to keep it about O(1). One of the idea is recreate (resize) array when k become too big (for example K\\*n is equal to N, where n - not empty cells, N - array size). The second idea is to use all the memory of the array to store the elements, and not occupy additional memory with lists. Both of this ideas brings us to the senode method."

With this, we are much less likely to form large groups of elements at some place.

It is almost impossible to finally defeat this, as with a good choice of a pivot in quick sort. But there is a lot of diffrent hash fuctions that are trying to reduce the likelihood of collisions. One of the most famous is `double hashing`. In this method we take not one, but two diffrent hash function. Really diffrent. For example for string first hash function calculate the summ of elements and the second one the middel element multiple by string length. And don't forget made it relative prime to table size -> h2(s) = (s\\[middle\\]*len(s))*2 + 1. The result hash function is h(s) = h1(s) + h2(s)*k, k - step."
