When you use some algorithms, you should know, how it work, how many memory it can take, and how long it can work. So, in other worlds, the last two points calling complexity of algorithm. In mathematic laguage it's look like function `f(x)` whose values are equal to time algorithm will take if it will start working with data of size 'x'. Actually we can excatly calculate f(x), but it will take a big amount of time and resources.

    "  Simple. You should use two stacks to do it. The first one will be collect incoming elements. When some one ask for elemen, you just send all of them from the first stack to second and then take the top element from the second. Because you put at the second stack elements in reverse order (from the top of first stack to the bottom of the second), the second stack will back the element that came in the queue first. After you send elements to the second stack, you can take them from it until it not become empty. The complexity of addElement is O(1), of popElement is O(1) till second stack not empty. But even when it happens the complexity of transfer of elements between stacks is O(n) and it happens one time in n function calling. So, 1(n+1)/n ~ 1. So, in average complexity of pop is O(1). \n",

    "The last but not the least container... is the ~~least~~ list. It exaclty made from number of lists that connected with each other. There two famous type of lists: singly linked list and doubly linked list. So, the first one is the stucture, that contain data and link to the next list. Users have the link only to start list and from it all function work. A double linked list differs from singly only in that double linked list contain two link to previous and next element.\n",

    "So, like in previous containers, let's look at what we can do with list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constructor - `O(1)`\n",
    "2. GetAtIndex (i) - take element from list with index (the number of elements between the first and the requested). Because every element of list saved at diffrent position in memory (they are not stored one by one) and have link to next element, we need to go through all the elements starting from the first to requested. So, in average `O(n)`.\n",
    "3. FindElement (element) - search for element in list. `O(n)`\n",
    "4. PushBack (element) - save element at the end of the list. `O(1)` (because we can keep link to the end of the list)\n",
    "5. PopBack () - Take element from the end. `O(1)`\n",
    "6. PushFront (element) - save element at the begining of list. `O(1)`\n",
    "7. PopFront - Take element from the begining. `O(1)`\n",
    "8. ChangeElement (elem, changeElem) - change element 'elem' to 'changeElem'. `O(n)` to find element and `O(1)` to change it.\n",
    "9. InsertElem (elem, position) - if position is the link to list, than it will cost `O(1)`, because we only need to create new element and connect lists at position (previous and next) to new one. This is main differences from array, because for array insert element in middle require rewrite all array.\n",
    "10. DeleteElem (position or elem) - if position was given, than `O(1)`, becuse we need only relink previous and next lists to each other and delete old one. If element was given, than `O(n)` to find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "About implementation - in contrast with stack and queue, there is only one basic implementataion of list - with structure, that contain link to next (and previous, if double linked) element and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no linked or double linked list in basic python. The list that you use in it is actualy array and work as array (with O(1) access time and O(n) adding element to begining). So, if you want, you can implemented it by your oun."
